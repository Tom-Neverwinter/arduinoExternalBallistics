arduinoExternalBallistics
=========================

Arduino External Ballistics Calculator based on "GNU_Exterior_Ballistics_Library_0.100a" from http://sourceforge.net/projects/ballisticslib/ which is GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)


HAS NOT BEEN TESTED YET! I MADE IT COMPILE AND NEED TO FIND TIME TO RUN TESTS.

Further ideas:
- Adapting barometric sensor [external component]
- Adapting temperature sensor [external component]
- Adapting wind speed and direction measurement [external component]
- Adapting gyroscope for elevation measurement (also for leveling the gun from horizontal perspective - keep the crosshair as upright as possible) [attached to rifle's weaver rail]
- Adapting compass for wind direction adjustment calculation [attached to rifle's weaver rail]
